## Learning Path

### Module 1: Introduction to AI and Large Language Models

Get acquainted with the fundamentals of artificial intelligence and the emergence of large language models (LLMs). Youâ€™ll learn basic terminology and discover real-world use cases that showcase the power of LLMs.

**Topics covered:**

- [Overview of AI, ML, and NLP: definitions and relationships ðŸ“–](https://lumorikllc.github.io/learn/content/a23f2f35-2cd5-455f-b58b-fa1815dadfd1/ef687bdd-ddc0-4295-8002-85681040e3b9)
- What is a Large Language Model: scope and capabilities
- Key terms: tokens, parameters, inference
- Major LLM milestones and flagship models
- Common applications and success stories

---

### Module 2: Core Concepts: Tokenization, Embeddings, and the Transformer

Dive into the building blocks of LLMs by understanding how text is represented and processed. Study the transformer architecture that underpins modern language models.

**Topics covered:**

- Tokenization methods: word, subword, and byte-pair encoding
- Creating and using embeddings to represent words
- Self-attention and multi-head attention mechanisms
- Transformer encoder and decoder blocks
- How inference works: from prompt to output

---

### Module 3: Getting Started with an LLM API

Learn how to access production-ready LLMs via APIs. Youâ€™ll set up your environment, make basic calls, and handle responses in code.

**Topics covered:**

- Choosing an API provider and plan
- Obtaining API credentials and managing keys securely
- Making your first API request and parsing the JSON response
- Setting parameters: model, temperature, max tokens
- Monitoring usage, quotas, and cost optimization

---

### Module 4: Prompt Engineering Fundamentals

Master the art of crafting effective prompts to guide LLM outputs. Explore techniques for clear instructions, few-shot examples, and iterative refinement.

**Topics covered:**

- Structuring prompts: system vs. user instructions
- Creating few-shot and zero-shot examples
- Adjusting temperature and top-p for creativity vs. precision
- Techniques for steering style, tone, and format
- Iterative testing and refining prompts for better results

---

### Module 5: Evaluating and Refining Model Outputs

Build skills to assess the quality and reliability of generated text. Learn methods for quantitative and qualitative evaluation, error analysis, and continuous improvement.

**Topics covered:**

- Defining success metrics: accuracy, coherence, relevance
- Human vs. automated evaluation approaches
- Identifying common pitfalls: hallucinations and biases
- Parameter tuning: temperature, max tokens, penalties
- Creating feedback loops and A/B testing prompts

---

### Module 6: Fine-Tuning and Embedding Applications

Customize LLM behavior for specialized tasks through fine-tuning and embedding-based retrieval. Discover how to prepare data and deploy customized models.

**Topics covered:**

- Preparing and cleaning domain-specific datasets
- Fine-tuning basics with API or open-source tools
- Generating and using embeddings for semantic search
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows
- Best practices for versioning and model management

---

### Module 7: Deployment, Ethics, and Safety
