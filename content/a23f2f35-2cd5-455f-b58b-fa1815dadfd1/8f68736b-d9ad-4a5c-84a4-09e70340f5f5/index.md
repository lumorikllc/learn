## Learning Path

### üìö Module 1: LLM Fine-Tuning Foundations

Establish the core concepts of post-training for large language models. You will learn how fine-tuning differs from pretraining, explore supervised fine-tuning workflows, and understand the evaluation metrics used to judge LLM performance.

**Topics covered:**

- Contrast pretraining vs. post-training objectives in LLMs
- [Implement a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline üìñ](https://lumorikllc.github.io/learn/content/a23f2f35-2cd5-455f-b58b-fa1815dadfd1/73ef50c6-8566-4a13-8dfe-d7424b4af8ca)
- Choose and compute common loss functions for text tasks
- Curate and preprocess datasets for fine-tuning
- Evaluate model outputs using BLEU, ROUGE, and human judgments

---

### üéØ Module 2: Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals

Dive into the core mechanics of reinforcement learning. Cover Markov decision processes, policy vs. value methods, and popular algorithms to prepare for applying RL to LLMs.

**Topics covered:**

- Define MDP components: states, actions, rewards, transitions
- Derive and code the policy gradient theorem
- Implement a vanilla policy gradient method on a toy problem
- Understand value functions and actor‚Äìcritic architectures
- Study Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and clipping techniques

---

### ü§ñ Module 3: Applying RL to Language Models

Adapt RL principles to sequence generation. Learn how to model a language model as an RL agent, shape rewards at the token and sequence level, and handle large action spaces.

**Topics covered:**

- Formulate the LLM‚Äôs token predictions as actions in an RL setting
- Design reward functions for fluency, relevance, and coherence
- Implement on-policy sampling and batch rollout for text
- Address exploration vs. exploitation in sequence decoding
- Stabilize training: reward normalization and variance reduction

---

### üó£Ô∏è Module 4: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

Unpack the RLHF pipeline end to end. Focus on gathering human preference data, training a reward model, and integrating it into an RL loop to align LLM outputs with human values.

**Topics covered:**

- Collect and format human preference comparisons
- Train a reward model (e.g., using a transformer encoder)
- Calibrate reward outputs and monitor overfitting
- Integrate the reward model into PPO training
- Evaluate alignment: preference accuracy and fairness checks

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Module 5: Hands-On RLHF Implementation

Get practical experience with RLHF frameworks. Set up and run experiments using open-source libraries, fine-tune hyperparameters, and debug common training issues.

**Topics covered:**

- Install and configure the TRL (Transformers Reinforcement Learning) library
- Write and run a PPO training script for your LLM
- Tune learning rate, batch size, and KL-penalty coefficient
- Monitor metrics: reward curves, KL divergence, and loss trends
- Perform ablation studies to isolate the impact of each component

### üî¨ Module 6: Research Insights and Paper Collaboration

Survey seminal and recent RLHF research to inform your collaboration. Identify open problems, design experiments, and start structuring your joint paper.

**Topics covered:**

- Summarize key papers: InstructGPT, DeepMind‚Äôs Sparrow, etc.
- Analyze failure modes: reward hacking and distributional shift
- Draft novel research questions or methodological improvements
- Design experiments and evaluation protocols
- Outline and co-write the paper: from abstract to conclusions
