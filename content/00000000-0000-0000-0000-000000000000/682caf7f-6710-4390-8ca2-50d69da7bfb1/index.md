## Learning Path

### Module 1: Foundations of LLMs and RAG

Get grounded in how large language models work and the core concepts behind Retrieval Augmented Generation. You‚Äôll explore transformer basics, prompt engineering, and the end‚Äêto‚Äêend RAG workflow.

**Topics covered:**

- [Overview of transformer architecture and model capabilities üìñ](https://lumorikllc.github.io/learn/content/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/0b99779c-af99-49ba-8aca-a4e5b49d1e63)
- Principles of prompt engineering and prompt templates
- RAG workflow: document ingestion, retrieval, and generation
- Key evaluation metrics for RAG (e.g., relevance, fluency)

---

### Module 2: Vector Embeddings and Databases

Learn to convert text into vector embeddings and store them efficiently for similarity search. This module covers embedding models, vector stores, and performance considerations.

**Topics covered:**

- Generating embeddings with models like sentence-transformers or OpenAI Embeddings
- Indexing and querying vectors in FAISS, Pinecone or Weaviate
- Similarity search algorithms (e.g., cosine, dot-product)
- Scaling and latency optimization in vector databases

---

### Module 3: LangChain Basics

Dive into LangChain‚Äôs core abstractions for building chains and pipelines around LLMs. You‚Äôll install the library, understand key classes, and create simple chains.

**Topics covered:**

- Installing and configuring LangChain in Python
- Understanding LLM wrappers, prompt templates, and chains
- Building and chaining simple calls (LLM ‚Üí prompt ‚Üí output)
- Testing and debugging chains with mock inputs

---

### Module 4: Building RAG Pipelines with LangChain

Combine your vector store and LangChain knowledge to build a full RAG pipeline. You‚Äôll implement document loaders, chunking, retrieval, and answer generation.

**Topics covered:**

- Connecting LangChain to a vector database via a retriever
- Implementing document loading and text chunking strategies
- Creating a RetrievalQA chain and customizing retrieval parameters
- Logging, error handling, and basic prompt refinements

---

### Module 5: Introduction to Autonomous AI Agents

Discover how to augment LLMs with tools and functions to build autonomous agents. You‚Äôll learn about LangChain agents, tool integration, and basic memory management.

**Topics covered:**

- Concepts of AI agents: tools, actions, and observations
- Using OpenAI function calling and custom tool definitions
- Implementing zero-shot and few-shot agents in LangChain
- Basic in‚Äêmemory state and short-term conversational memory

---

### Module 6: Advanced Agent Orchestration

Scale your agents to handle more complex workflows and long-term context. Explore multi-agent setups, persistent memory, and external API integrations.

**Topics covered:**

- Designing multi-agent workflows and task delegation
- Implementing long-term vector or SQL memory stores
- Integrating external APIs (e.g., web search, databases, custom endpoints)
- Monitoring, logging, and failure recovery strategies

---

### Module 7: Capstone Project: End-to-End AI Agent with RAG

Apply everything you‚Äôve learned to build, deploy, and monitor a complete AI agent system. You‚Äôll define requirements, implement code, and deploy to production.

**Topics covered:**

- Project scoping: defining user stories and success metrics
- Integrating RAG retrieval pipeline with autonomous agent logic
- Containerizing and deploying using Docker or cloud services
- Setting up monitoring, alerting, and iterative improvements
