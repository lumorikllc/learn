## Learning Path

### Module 1: Getting Started with Python

Set up your Python environment and learn the fundamentals of writing and running your first scripts. You’ll get comfortable with the REPL, variables, and basic syntax.

**Topics covered:**

- Installing Python and choosing an IDE (VS Code, PyCharm)
- Using the Python REPL and running .py scripts
- Understanding basic data types: integers, floats, strings
- Working with variables and simple expressions
- Printing output and using comments

---

### Module 2: Control Flow and Looping

Learn to direct the flow of your programs using conditionals and loops. These tools let your code make decisions and repeat tasks efficiently.

**Topics covered:**

- Writing if, elif, and else statements
- Using for loops to iterate over sequences
- Implementing while loops for repeated actions
- Applying list comprehensions for concise looping
- Handling basic exceptions with try/except

---

### Module 3: Core Data Structures

Explore Python’s built-in data structures for organizing and accessing collections of data. You’ll practice storing, retrieving, and transforming information.

**Topics covered:**

- Creating and manipulating lists and list methods
- Working with tuples and understanding immutability
- Using dictionaries for key/value storage and lookup
- Leveraging sets for unique-element operations
- Converting between data structures

---

### Module 4: Functions and Modular Code

Build reusable blocks of code with functions and learn to organize your project into modules. This step improves readability and maintainability.

**Topics covered:**

- Defining functions with parameters and return values
- Understanding variable scope and default arguments
- Using *args and **kwargs for flexible interfaces
- Importing built-in modules and third-party packages
- Structuring code into multiple .py files

---

### Module 5: File I/O and Task Automation

Automate routine tasks by reading from and writing to files. You’ll practice handling data files and scripting simple automation workflows.

**Topics covered:**

- Opening, reading, and writing text files
- Working with CSV files using the csv module
- Renaming, moving, and deleting files with os and shutil
- Automating batch operations with looped scripts
- Scheduling scripts with cron (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows)

---

### Module 6: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics

Design your own data types using classes and objects. OOP helps model real-world entities and encourages clean code organization.

**Topics covered:**

- Defining classes and creating object instances
- Implementing __init__, instance methods, and attributes
- Using class methods and static methods
- Applying inheritance and polymorphism
- Overriding magic methods like __str__ and __repr__

---

### Module 7: Working with Libraries and Building Projects

Leverage popular Python libraries to handle data and web requests. Combine your skills in a small end-to-end project for real-world practice.

**Topics covered:**

- Using pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Fetching data from APIs with the requests library
- Parsing JSON and handling HTTP responses
- Visualizing data with pandas or matplotlib basics
- Capstone project: automate data retrieval, analysis, and reporting
