## Chapter Overview
Python underpins virtually every data engineering task. Grasping its data types, control flow, and functions unlocks efficient data manipulation and reusable code. With these fundamentals, you’ll write clear, concise scripts that form the backbone of ETL pipelines and analytical workflows.

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Identify and use Python’s core **data types** effectively.
- Implement **control flow** using conditionals and loops.
- Define and call **functions** with parameters and return values to encapsulate logic.

## Key Concepts & Definitions
- **Python**: A high-level, interpreted programming language known for readability and versatility.  
- **Data type**: A classification that specifies the kind of values and operations allowed.  
- **Integer** (`int`): A whole number, positive or negative, without fractional parts.  
- **Floating point** (`float`): A number containing a fractional component, represented using decimal notation.  
- **String** (`str`): An immutable sequence of Unicode characters.  
- **List** (`list`): A mutable, ordered collection of items.  
- **Tuple** (`tuple`): An immutable, ordered collection of items.  
- **Dictionary** (`dict`): A mutable, unordered collection of key–value pairs.  
- **Boolean** (`bool`): A data type with two values: `True` or `False`.  
- **Control flow**: Mechanisms (`if`, `for`, `while`) that direct the execution path of code.  
- **Conditional**: A statement (`if`/`else`) that executes code only when a Boolean expression holds.  
- **Loop**: A construct (`for` or `while`) that repeats code until a condition changes.  
- **Function**: A reusable block of code that performs a specific task.  
- **Parameter**: A variable listed in a function’s definition.  
- **Argument**: A value passed to a function’s parameter when calling it.  
- **Return value**: The result a function sends back to the caller.

These concepts interrelate: you store data in typed **variables**, use **control flow** to decide or repeat actions on those variables, and group related operations into **functions** for modular, maintainable code.

## Main Exposition

### Python Data Types
Python provides built-in types to represent various data:
- **Integers** and **floats** for numeric computations.
- **Strings** for text manipulation.
- **Lists** and **tuples** for ordered collections.
- **Dictionaries** for mapping keys to values.
- **Booleans** for truth tests.

Example:
```python
count = 42                   # int
pi = 3.1415                  # float
name = "Data Engineer"       # str
tags = ["ETL", "Spark", 2024]# list
config = ("host", "port")    # tuple
settings = {"debug": True}   # dict
```
Operations respect type rules: you can add ints or floats, concatenate strings or lists, but mixing types without conversion raises errors.

### Control Flow
Control flow dictates your program’s path.

#### Conditionals
```python
x = 10
if x % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")
```
- `if` tests a Boolean expression.
- `elif` adds additional checks.
- `else` handles all other cases.

#### Loops
`for` loops iterate over sequences:
```python
for tag in tags:
    print(tag)
```
`while` loops repeat until a condition is false:
```python
n = 5
while n > 0:
    print(n)
    n -= 1
```

### Functions
Functions encapsulate logic, improving readability and reuse.

#### Defining and Calling
```python
def greet(name):
    """Return a greeting for the given name."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

message = greet("Alice")
print(message)  # Hello, Alice!
```
- **Parameters**: `name`
- **Arguments**: `"Alice"`
- **Return**: greeting string

#### Multiple Parameters and Defaults
```python
def power(base, exponent=2):
    return base ** exponent

print(power(3))     # 9
print(power(2, 3))  # 8
```
Default parameters allow flexible calls.

#### Variable Scope
Variables defined inside a function are **local**; those outside are **global**. Avoid unintentional global modifications.

## Applications & Real-World Context

Scenario 1: Log File Analyzer  
A data engineer writes a Python script to parse server logs line by line. Each line (a **string**) is split into fields, cast to **integers** or **floats**, and filtered using **conditionals** (e.g., only process status codes ≥400). A **for** loop iterates through lines, and a `parse_line()` **function** returns structured data. This modular approach isolates parsing logic, making it easy to extend for new log formats.

Scenario 2: ETL Batch Processor  
An ETL job reads rows from a CSV into a **list** of lists. Using a **for** loop, the script applies a transformation **function** `normalize_dates(row)` to each row. **Dictionaries** map column names to indices, enabling dynamic field access. A **while** loop monitors file pointers for incremental loads. Clear data types and functions ensure that numeric, string, and date values are handled consistently before loading into a database.

## Common Misconceptions & Pitfalls
1. Integer vs. Float Division  
   - Pitfall: In Python 3, `/` always returns a `float`. Use `//` for integer division.  
   - Correction: `5/2 == 2.5`, but `5//2 == 2`.

2. Mutable Default Arguments  
   - Pitfall: Using a mutable default (e.g., `def f(x, lst=[])`) shares the same list across calls.  
   - Correction: Use `None` as default and create a new list inside:  
     ```python
     def f(x, lst=None):
         lst = lst or []
     ```

3. Off-by-One Errors in Loops  
   - Pitfall: Iterating `for i in range(len(lst))` and accessing `lst[i+1]` may exceed bounds.  
   - Correction: Validate indices or iterate direct items: `for current, nxt in zip(lst, lst[1:]):`.

## Worked Example Problem
Problem:  
Write a function `filter_and_sum(nums, threshold)` that:
1. Takes a list of integers `nums`.
2. Filters out all values less than `threshold`.
3. Returns the sum of the remaining values.

Solution:
1. **Define function signature**:
   ```python
   def filter_and_sum(nums, threshold):
   ```
2. **Filter values** using a list comprehension:
   ```python
       filtered = [n for n in nums if n >= threshold]
   ```
3. **Compute sum**:
   ```python
       total = sum(filtered)
   ```
4. **Return result**:
   ```python
       return total
   ```
Full code with commentary:
```python
def filter_and_sum(nums, threshold):
    # Step 2: select numbers ≥ threshold
    filtered = [n for n in nums if n >= threshold]
    # Step 3: sum the selected numbers
    total = sum(filtered)
    # Step 4: return final sum
    return total

# Example call
result = filter_and_sum([3, 10, 7, 1, 9], 7)
print(result)  # Outputs 26 (10 + 7 + 9)
```
Why it matters: Breaking the problem into filtering and summing promotes clarity and reuse: you could reuse the filtering logic elsewhere.

## Practice Exercises
Q1. List four built-in Python data types and give an example of each.

Q2. What is printed by this code?
```python
x = 5
if x > 3:
    print("A")
elif x > 10:
    print("B")
else:
    print("C")
```

Q3. Write a `while` loop that prints the even numbers from 2 to 10 inclusive.

Q4. Define a function `multiply(a, b=1)` that returns the product of `a` and `b`. Show two calls: one with both arguments, one with only `a`.

Q5. Explain the difference between **parameters** and **arguments** in your own words.

## Summary & Further Reading
- Python’s **data types** (`int`, `float`, `str`, `list`, `tuple`, `dict`, `bool`) form the basis of all operations.  
- Use **conditionals** (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to branch logic based on Boolean expressions.  
- **Loops** (`for`, `while`) automate repetitive tasks over sequences or conditions.  
- **Functions** encapsulate code, accept **parameters**, receive **arguments**, and return results.  
- Avoid common pitfalls like mutable default arguments and off-by-one errors.

## Solutions
A1.  
- `int`: `42`  
- `float`: `3.14`  
- `str`: `"hello"`  
- `list`: `[1, 2, 3]`  

A2.  
Prints `A`, because `x > 3` is `True` and the first branch executes.

A3.
```python
n = 2
while n <= 10:
    print(n)
    n += 2
```

A4.
```python
def multiply(a, b=1):
    return a * b

print(multiply(4, 5))  # 20
print(multiply(7))     # 7
```

A5.  
A **parameter** is a variable in a function’s definition (e.g., `a`, `b`). An **argument** is the actual value passed to that parameter when calling the function (e.g., `4`, `5`).
