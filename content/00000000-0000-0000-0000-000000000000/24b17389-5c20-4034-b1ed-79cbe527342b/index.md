## Learning Path

### Module 1: Foundations: Data Structures & Complexity Analysis

Build a rock-solid base in the core data structures and learn how to analyze algorithmic efficiency. Mastering these fundamentals is critical for all coding interviews.

**Topics covered:**

- Arrays & Strings (two-pointer, sliding window patterns)
- Linked Lists (reversal, cycle detection, merging)
- Stacks & Queues (implementation, use-cases)
- Trees & Graphs (traversals, representations)
- Complexity Analysis (Big O, amortized time, space trade-offs)

---

### Module 2: Core Algorithmic Paradigms

Dive into the main algorithmic techniques that power efficient solutions. Practice designing and analyzing these patterns to solve increasingly complex problems.

**Topics covered:**

- Sorting & Searching (quicksort, mergesort, binary search)
- Recursion & Backtracking (permutations, subsets, N-Queens)
- Dynamic Programming (memoization, tabulation, knapsack, LIS)
- Greedy Algorithms (interval scheduling, coin change)
- Graph Algorithms (BFS/DFS, Dijkstra's, MST with Kruskal/Prim)

---

### Module 3: Intensive LeetCode Practice & Pattern Recognition

Translate theory into practice with targeted LeetCode sessions. Identify common problem patterns and refine your coding style under timed conditions.

**Topics covered:**

- Pattern Drills (sliding window, two pointers, fast & slow)
- Timed Mock Sessions (45-minute coding simulations)
- Complexity Optimization (brute force → O(n log n) or better)
- Code Reviews & Refactoring (clean code, modular functions)
- LeetCode Company Tags (filter by FAANG-specific problems)

---

### Module 4: System Design Fundamentals & Architecture

Learn to design large-scale systems from the ground up. Focus on gathering requirements, defining components, and modeling data effectively.

**Topics covered:**

- Requirements Gathering (functional vs. non-functional)
- High-Level Architecture (service decomposition, component diagrams)
- Data Modeling (ER diagrams, schema design, indexing)
- API Design (REST vs. gRPC, endpoint contracts)
- Caching & Load Balancing (patterns, CDN, consistent hashing)

---

### Module 5: Scalability & Distributed Systems

Understand how to scale services to handle massive traffic. Explore distributed data stores, messaging systems, and reliability patterns.

**Topics covered:**

- Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling Strategies
- Distributed Data Stores (sharding, replication, consistency models)
- Message Queues & Streaming (Kafka, RabbitMQ, pub/sub)
- CAP Theorem Trade-offs (availability, partition tolerance, consistency)
- Monitoring & Reliability (health checks, metrics, alerting)

---

### Module 6: Behavioral Interviews & Cultural Fit

Prepare compelling stories using the STAR framework and internalize each company’s core values. Practice clear, concise communication to demonstrate leadership and teamwork.

**Topics covered:**

- STAR Method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
- Amazon Leadership Principles Deep Dive
- Meta, Google & Netflix Cultural Values
- Story Preparation (failure, success, conflict resolution)
- Communication Skills (clarity, active listening, conciseness)

---

### Module 7: Mock Interviews & Company-Specific Strategies

Simulate real interview scenarios and incorporate feedback into your study plan. Tailor your preparation to each FAANG process and set a clear timeline to track progress.

**Topics covered:**

- Technical Mock Interviews (peers, platforms like Pramp, interviewing.io)
- Feedback Analysis & Action Plans
- Company-Specific Question Sets & Process Overviews
- Milestone-Based Timeline (weekly targets, progress checkpoints)
- Stress Management & Interview Day Best Practices
