## Learning Path

### 📦 Module 1: Containerization Fundamentals

Gain a solid understanding of containers and how they revolutionize application deployment. You’ll learn Docker basics and prepare container images for Kubernetes orchestration.

**Topics covered:**

- Compare containers vs. virtual machines
- Build and run Docker images using Dockerfile
- Manage image registries and versioning
- Use Docker CLI to start, stop, and inspect containers

---

### 🏗️ Module 2: Kubernetes Architecture & Core Concepts

Dive into the architecture of a Kubernetes cluster and its primary components. Understand how Pods, Nodes, and control-plane elements collaborate to run and manage workloads.

**Topics covered:**

- Describe control plane components: API Server, etcd, Scheduler, Controller Manager
- Explain worker node elements: kubelet, kube-proxy, container runtime
- Define objects: Pods, ReplicaSets, Deployments & Services
- Understand Kubernetes networking model and cluster DNS

---

### ⚙️ Module 3: Setting Up & Interacting with a Cluster

Learn to spin up and configure your own Kubernetes cluster locally or in the cloud. Practice with kubectl to inspect, troubleshoot, and manage cluster resources.

**Topics covered:**

- Install Minikube or kind for local cluster setup
- Use kubeadm for a multi-node cluster (optional)
- Master kubectl commands: get, describe, logs, exec
- Understand and write basic YAML manifests

---

### 🚀 Module 4: Deploying and Managing Workloads

Deploy real applications on Kubernetes and manage their lifecycle. Explore different workload controllers to achieve desired state, high availability, and rolling updates.

**Topics covered:**

- Create and manage Pods, Deployments, and ReplicaSets
- Perform rolling updates and rollbacks
- Use labels and selectors for organizing workloads
- Experiment with DaemonSets and StatefulSets

---

### 🌐 Module 5: Services, Networking & Ingress

Expose your applications and configure networking to allow internal and external traffic. Implement Ingress and network policies for secure, scalable access.

**Topics covered:**

- Define Service types: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer
- Set up and configure Ingress resources and controllers
- Apply Network Policies for traffic segmentation
- Use port-forwarding and DNS within the cluster

---

### 🔒 Module 6: Configuration, Secrets & Persistent Storage

Manage application configuration and sensitive data securely. Learn to provision and consume persistent volumes to handle stateful workloads.

**Topics covered:**

- Create and consume ConfigMaps for environment configuration
- Store and access sensitive data with Secrets
- Define PersistentVolumes (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC)
- Implement StorageClasses and dynamic volume provisioning

---

### 📈 Module 7: Scaling, Monitoring & CI/CD Integration

Automate scaling and integrate CI/CD pipelines for continuous delivery. Instrument your cluster with monitoring and use Helm to manage complex deployments.

**Topics covered:**

- Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and metrics-server
- Set up Prometheus and Grafana for cluster metrics
- Package applications with Helm charts
- Integrate a CI/CD tool (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) for automated deployments
