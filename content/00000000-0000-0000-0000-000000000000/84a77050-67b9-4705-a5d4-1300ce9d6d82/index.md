## Learning Path

### Module 1: Mathematical and Statistical Foundations

Build a strong base in the mathematical and statistical concepts that underpin data science. You’ll learn how to describe data, understand probability, and see why linear algebra and calculus matter for algorithms.

**Topics covered:**

- Descriptive statistics: mean, median, mode, variance
- Probability basics: distributions, Bayes’ theorem
- Linear algebra essentials: vectors, matrices, operations
- Calculus overview: derivatives and integrals for optimization

---

### Module 2: Python Programming for Data Analysis

Learn core Python programming skills tailored to data work. Focus on writing clean code, using data structures, and working efficiently in Jupyter Notebooks.

**Topics covered:**

- Python syntax: variables, data types, control flow
- Functions and modules: definition, import, reuse
- Built-in data structures: lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
- Jupyter Notebook workflow: cells, magic commands, markdown

---

### Module 3: Data Manipulation with pandas and NumPy

Master the tools for cleaning and preparing data at scale. You’ll manipulate arrays and DataFrames, handle missing values, and perform group-wise operations.

**Topics covered:**

- NumPy arrays: creation, indexing, vectorized operations
- pandas DataFrame: loading data, indexing, selection
- Data cleaning: missing data, duplicates, type conversions
- Transformations: filtering, grouping, aggregation, joins

---

### Module 4: Data Visualization Techniques

Explore methods to communicate insights through charts and dashboards. You’ll use both static and interactive libraries to tell compelling data stories.

**Topics covered:**

- Matplotlib basics: line, bar, scatter plots, customization
- Seaborn: statistical plots, styling, subplots
- Interactive charts with Plotly: scatter, maps, dashboards
- Visualization best practices: chart selection, labeling, color

---

### Module 5: Statistical Analysis and Inference

Learn how to draw conclusions from data using statistical tests and experimental design. You’ll practice hypothesis testing and understand confidence intervals.

**Topics covered:**

- Hypothesis testing: t-tests, chi-square tests
- Confidence intervals: calculation and interpretation
- Correlation vs. causation: identifying spurious relationships
- Experimental design basics: A/B testing workflow

---

### Module 6: Machine Learning Fundamentals

Dive into core machine learning algorithms and evaluation techniques. You’ll build and tune models for both prediction and pattern discovery.

**Topics covered:**

- Supervised learning: linear regression, decision trees, classification
- Model evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, cross-validation
- Unsupervised learning: k-means clustering, PCA
- Overfitting and regularization: bias-variance tradeoff, L1/L2

---

### Module 7: Capstone Projects and Deployment

Apply everything in a real-world project and learn how to deliver a working model. You’ll follow an end-to-end workflow from data ingestion to deployment.

**Topics covered:**

- End-to-end project: problem definition, EDA, modeling, evaluation
- Model deployment: basic API with Flask or interactive app with Streamlit
- Version control and collaboration: Git, GitHub workflow
- Presentation and reporting: dashboards, documentation, storytelling
