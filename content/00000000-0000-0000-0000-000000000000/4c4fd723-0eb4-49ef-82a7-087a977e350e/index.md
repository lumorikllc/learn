## Learning Path

### üß† Module 1: Foundations of Visible Thinking

Learn the core principles of chain-of-thought reasoning in GPT-5 and how to craft prompts that surface the model‚Äôs internal logic. This module builds the foundation for creating transparent, interpretable AI outputs.

**Topics covered:**

- Explain the principles of chain-of-thought reasoning
- Craft prompts that encourage transparent reasoning traces
- Visualize intermediate reasoning steps in responses
- Assess the clarity of visible thinking outputs

### üìö Module 2: Managing the 272k-Token Context Window

Understand GPT-5‚Äôs expanded 272k-token context architecture and learn strategies to handle large inputs efficiently. You‚Äôll master chunking, memory buffers, and retrieval-augmented generation for dynamic context management.

**Topics covered:**

- Define the architecture of GPT-5‚Äôs 272k-token context window
- Implement context chunking strategies to manage large data
- Leverage memory buffers to simulate long-term memory
- Use retrieval-augmented generation for dynamic context injection
- Monitor context usage and optimize token allocation

### üõ†Ô∏è Module 3: Advanced Prompt Engineering

Dive into advanced prompt design tailored for complex, large-scale tasks. You‚Äôll build dynamic templates, apply contextual priming, and set up iterative refinement processes to maximize output quality.

**Topics covered:**

- Develop dynamic prompt templates for domain-specific tasks
- Use contextual priming to focus GPT-5 on relevant sections
- Implement meta-prompts to guide error correction
- Apply iterative refinement loops to improve output quality
- Validate prompt variations through controlled testing

---

### üîÑ Module 4: Workflow Automation & Orchestration

Design and automate end-to-end pipelines by chaining GPT-5 calls with conditional logic. Learn to build robust workflows that handle errors gracefully and scale across professional use cases.

**Topics covered:**

- Design modular pipeline workflows chaining GPT-5 calls
- Automate error handling and fallback strategies
- Schedule and orchestrate tasks using workflow managers
- Integrate conditional logic for adaptive processing

---

### üîó Module 5: Integration into Professional Tools

Connect GPT-5 to your existing toolset‚Äîcollaboration platforms, CMSs, and custom UIs‚Äîto streamline real-world workflows. You‚Äôll learn to trigger AI actions from events and embed conversational agents where your team works.

**Topics covered:**

- Connect GPT-5 API to collaboration platforms (e.g., Slack)
- Embed GPT-5 into content management systems (e.g., Notion)
- Configure event-based triggers with Zapier or IFTTT
- Develop custom web interfaces for user-driven prompts

---

### üìä Module 6: Monitoring, Evaluation & Optimization

Establish metrics and monitoring pipelines to track GPT-5 performance in production. Perform A/B tests on prompts, optimize parameters, and refine models to ensure consistent, high-quality results.

**Topics covered:**

- Define KPIs for response accuracy, relevance, and efficiency
- Implement logging and monitoring dashboards
- Conduct A/B tests on prompt variations
- Optimize API parameters (temperature, max tokens) for performance

---

### üöÄ Module 7: Scaling, Governance & Best Practices

Plan for enterprise-grade deployment by addressing security, compliance, and cost management. Learn governance best practices and infrastructure strategies to scale GPT-5 responsibly.

**Topics covered:**

- Establish access controls and role-based permissions
- Implement data governance and compliance workflows
- Monitor usage costs and apply cost-saving measures
- Plan for scaling infrastructure and load balancing
