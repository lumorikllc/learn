## Learning Path

### 🌐 Module 1: Networking Fundamentals Deep Dive

Establish a solid foundation by exploring core networking models, IP addressing, and cabling. Balance theory with hands-on IP subnetting exercises and connector identification labs.

**Topics covered:**

- Compare OSI and TCP/IP model layers and their functions
- Perform IPv4 and IPv6 addressing, subnetting, and VLSM
- Identify common network topologies, cables, and connectors
- Examine key protocols and well-known ports (HTTP, DNS, DHCP)

---

### 🔧 Module 2: Implementing Network Devices

Learn to install and configure routers, switches, and wireless components. Pair each configuration exercise with note review sessions to reinforce command syntax and best practices.

**Topics covered:**

- Configure basic router and switch settings
- Implement VLANs and inter-VLAN routing
- Set up wireless LANs with SSIDs and security modes
- Deploy virtualization and cloud-based network resources

---

### 📊 Module 3: Network Operations & Monitoring

Master the tools and techniques for maintaining optimal network performance. Combine lab work on real-time monitoring tools with documentation practice to streamline operations.

**Topics covered:**

- Monitor network health using SNMP and other tools
- Analyze logs and alerts for proactive issue detection
- Apply QoS methods to prioritize critical traffic
- Document configurations and update network diagrams

---

### 🛡️ Module 4: Securing & Troubleshooting Networks

Integrate security measures into your network designs and learn structured troubleshooting methodologies. Alternate hands-on firewall/VPN labs with mock incident scenarios.

**Topics covered:**

- Apply security best practices for network devices
- Configure ACLs, firewalls, and VPN tunnels
- Use troubleshooting tools (ping, traceroute, netstat)
- Resolve common connectivity and performance issues

---

### 📘 Module 5: Security+ Foundations & Governance

Transition into Security+ by grasping core security principles and governance frameworks. Pair policy-writing exercises with risk assessment labs to cement concepts.

**Topics covered:**

- Explain the CIA triad and basic security concepts
- Develop security policies, standards, and procedures
- Perform risk assessments and apply mitigation strategies
- Interpret compliance frameworks (e.g., PCI-DSS, GDPR)

---

### 🔒 Module 6: Network & Host Security Controls

Build expertise in deploying network and endpoint security solutions. Conduct lab exercises on firewalls, IDS/IPS, and endpoint protection, then review configuration notes.

**Topics covered:**

- Deploy and configure firewalls, IDS/IPS systems
- Implement host-based security (antivirus, EDR)
- Design secure network segments and DMZs
- Set up VPNs and secure remote access

---

### 🕵️ Module 7: Threats, Vulnerabilities & Assessment

Identify, analyze, and counteract threats and vulnerabilities. Alternate vulnerability scanning and basic penetration testing labs with threat reporting reviews.

**Topics covered:**

- Classify threats, attack vectors, and malware types
- Conduct vulnerability scans and interpret results
- Perform basic penetration testing techniques
- Analyze social engineering tactics and defenses

---

### 🔑 Module 8: Secure Architecture & Identity Management

Finalize your Security+ prep by designing resilient architectures and implementing IAM. Practice cloud security and disaster recovery labs, then summarize key takeaways.

**Topics covered:**

- Apply secure architecture principles and frameworks
- Implement identity and access management (RBAC, MFA)
- Secure cloud and virtualization environments
- Plan and validate disaster recovery and BCP procedures
