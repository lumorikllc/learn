## Learning Path

### Module 1: Getting Started with Python

Set up your development environment and learn Python’s basic syntax. You’ll run simple scripts, work with variables and data types, and perform basic input/output.

**Topics covered:**

- Install Python and choose an IDE or code editor (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)
- Run Python scripts from the command line and REPL
- Understand and use basic data types: integers, floats, strings, booleans
- Perform arithmetic operations and string formatting
- Use input() to capture user input and print() for output

---

### Module 2: Control Flow and Functions

Learn how to control the flow of your programs with conditions and loops, then encapsulate logic into reusable functions. You’ll write, call, and test functions with parameters and return values.

**Topics covered:**

- Write if, elif, and else statements for conditional logic
- Implement for and while loops to iterate over data
- Define functions with def, use parameters and return statements
- Explore variable scope, default arguments, and keyword arguments
- Document functions using docstrings and basic unit tests

---

### Module 3: Working with Data Structures and Files

Master Python’s core data structures and learn to persist and retrieve data. You’ll manipulate lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries, then practice reading from and writing to files with error handling.

**Topics covered:**

- Use list methods (append, remove, sort) and list slicing
- Work with tuples, sets, and understand use cases for each
- Create, access, and update dictionaries for key-value data
- Read from and write to text and CSV files using open()
- Handle exceptions with try, except, finally blocks

---

### Module 4: Modules, Packages, and Virtual Environments

Organize code into reusable modules and manage project dependencies. You’ll explore the standard library, create your own packages, and use pip within isolated virtual environments.

**Topics covered:**

- Import and explore standard library modules (math, datetime)
- Structure code into modules and create __init__.py packages
- Set up and activate virtual environments with venv
- Install and manage third-party packages using pip
- Read package documentation and resolve version conflicts

---

### Module 5: Object-Oriented Programming in Python

Dive into OOP principles to build scalable, maintainable code. You’ll define classes, create objects, and leverage inheritance and magic methods to customize behavior.

**Topics covered:**

- Define classes and instantiate objects with __init__
- Add instance and class attributes, and define methods
- Implement inheritance and method overriding
- Use encapsulation: private vs. public attributes
- Override magic methods (e.g., __str__, __add__) for custom behavior

---

### Module 6: Working with Data and APIs

Fetch, process, and visualize real-world data. You’ll call REST APIs, parse JSON, manipulate tabular data with pandas, and create basic charts using matplotlib.

**Topics covered:**

- Send HTTP requests with requests and handle responses
- Parse JSON data into Python dictionaries and lists
- Load CSV data into pandas DataFrame and perform cleaning
- Use pandas for filtering, grouping, and aggregating data
- Plot line and bar charts with matplotlib

---

### Module 7: Capstone Project and Next Steps

Apply everything you’ve learned by building an end-to-end Python project. You’ll plan features, write and test code, version your work, and share it on GitHub.

**Topics covered:**

- Define project scope and break down requirements
- Set up project structure and virtual environment
- Implement core features using functions, OOP, and APIs
- Write tests, debug errors, and document your code
- Use Git for version control and publish your project on GitHub
