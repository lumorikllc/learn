## Learning Path

### Module 1: Getting Started & Environment Setup

Learn how to set up your development environment and write your first lines of JavaScript. You’ll understand how to link JS files to HTML and use browser developer tools for testing.

**Topics covered:**

- Install and configure a code editor (VS Code, Sublime) and browser dev tools
- Create an HTML file and link a .js script with the <script> tag
- Write your first console.log() and alert() statements
- Understand script placement (head vs. body) and defer/async attributes

---

### Module 2: Variables, Data Types & Operators

Dive into JavaScript’s core building blocks: variables and data types. You’ll learn how to store, identify, and manipulate data using operators.

**Topics covered:**

- Declare variables using var, let, and const and understand their differences
- Identify primitive data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol
- Use arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators
- Perform type conversion and understand coercion rules
- Build dynamic strings with template literals

---

### Module 3: Control Flow & Looping

Master decision-making in your code with conditionals and loops. You’ll control the execution path and automate repetitive tasks.

**Topics covered:**

- Write conditional logic using if, else if, and else statements
- Implement switch–case for multi-branch decisions
- Use for, for…of, and for…in loops to iterate over data
- Apply while and do…while loops for repeated execution
- Leverage the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions

---

### Module 4: Functions & Scope

Build reusable code blocks with functions and learn how JavaScript’s scope rules work. You’ll also explore modern syntax with arrow functions and closures.

**Topics covered:**

- Define functions via declarations and expressions
- Pass parameters, handle arguments, and return values
- Write arrow functions for concise callbacks
- Differentiate between global and local scope
- Understand closures and lexical scope

---

### Module 5: Working with Arrays & Objects

Handle complex data structures by mastering arrays and objects. You’ll learn to store collections, manipulate them, and iterate effectively.

**Topics covered:**

- Create and access arrays; use push, pop, shift, unshift
- Apply map, filter, and reduce for array transformations
- Define objects, read/write properties, and nest data
- Use object methods and the this keyword
- Iterate over arrays and object properties with forEach and for…in

---

### Module 6: DOM Manipulation & Events

Interact with web pages dynamically by selecting, modifying, and creating DOM elements. You’ll also learn to respond to user actions with event handling.

**Topics covered:**

- Select elements using document.getElementById, querySelector, and querySelectorAll
- Change element text, HTML content, and attributes
- Create, append, and remove DOM nodes dynamically
- Attach event listeners with addEventListener for click, input, and other events
- Implement event delegation and handle the event object
