## Learning Path

### 🗂️ Module 1: Note Triage and Foundation Alignment

In this initial step, you'll audit and triage your existing Network+ notes to establish a clear foundation. You'll categorize content by exam domain, pinpoint gaps, and set up a structured study roadmap aligned with your three-week timeline.

**Topics covered:**

- [Review and categorize existing notes by Network+ exam domains 📖](https://lumorikllc.github.io/learn/content/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/0b42b57e-0a25-43f1-ba07-5bdc00624e01)
- Identify high-priority topics and knowledge gaps
- Consolidate key formulas, definitions, and acronyms
- Develop a daily study schedule mapped to each domain

---

### 🌐 Module 2: Core Networking Concepts Refresher

Refresh core networking principles by delving into layered models and fundamental components. You'll solidify understanding of OSI/TCP-IP models, device roles, IP addressing, and cabling to ensure a robust base for advanced topics.

**Topics covered:**

- Explain OSI and TCP-IP model layers and functions
- Identify common network devices (switches, routers, firewalls)
- Practice IP addressing and subnetting calculations
- Differentiate Ethernet standards and cabling types

---

### 🔀 Module 3: Routing and Switching Essentials

Master routing and switching by exploring protocol operations and network segmentation. You'll configure VLANs, understand dynamic routing basics, and implement loop prevention mechanisms.

**Topics covered:**

- Compare static vs dynamic routing protocols (RIP, OSPF basics)
- Configure VLANs and trunking on switches
- Explain Spanning Tree Protocol concepts and loop prevention
- Understand QoS fundamentals and traffic prioritization

---

### 🏗️ Module 4: Network Services and Infrastructure

Explore essential network services and infrastructure components that support modern networks. You'll learn how DHCP and DNS work, configure wireless networks securely, and grasp virtualization and cloud networking concepts.

**Topics covered:**

- Describe DHCP operations and troubleshoot IP assignment
- Explain DNS record types and the resolution process
- Compare wireless standards (802.11a/b/g/n/ac) and security settings
- Outline virtualization and basic cloud networking models

---

### 🔒 Module 5: Network Security Fundamentals

Build a solid network security foundation by examining key protective technologies. You'll study firewalls, IDS/IPS, VPN solutions, and common vulnerabilities plus mitigation strategies.

**Topics covered:**

- Differentiate firewall types and configure basic rules
- Explain IDS/IPS functionalities and deployment scenarios
- Compare VPN technologies (IPsec vs SSL/TLS)
- Identify common network vulnerabilities and countermeasures

---

### 🧪 Module 6: Hands-On Labs and Mock Exams

Apply knowledge in hands-on labs and practice exams to reinforce learning. You'll set up virtual environments, tackle troubleshooting scenarios, and complete time-bound quizzes culminating in a full-length practice test.

**Topics covered:**

- Build a virtual lab for routing and switching practice
- Run security scenario simulations (IDS/IPS, VPN)
- Complete domain-focused timed quizzes
- Take and review a full-length Network+ practice exam

---

### 🎯 Module 7: Security+ Week 4 Handoff Preparation

Transition smoothly into Security+ preparation by aligning networking insights with week 4 objectives. You'll map Network+ concepts to Security+ domains, draft a tailored study guide, and plan upcoming sessions.

**Topics covered:**

- Review Security+ Week 4 exam objectives and key skills
- Map Network+ knowledge (IPsec, VLANs, IDS/IPS) to Security+ topics
- Create a concise Security+ study guide for week 4
- Schedule and prioritize Security+ practice sessions
