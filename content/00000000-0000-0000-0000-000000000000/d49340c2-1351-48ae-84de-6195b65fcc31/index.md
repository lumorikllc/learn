## Learning Path

### Module 1: Setting Up Your Python Environment and Basics

Install and configure a Python environment and learn the core syntax. You’ll practice writing simple scripts and get comfortable using interactive tools like Jupyter Notebook.

**Topics covered:**

- Install Anaconda or Python and configure VS Code or Jupyter Notebook
- Use the Python REPL and run .py scripts from the command line
- Understand basic data types: integers, floats, strings, booleans
- Work with variables and simple input/output operations

---

### Module 2: Control Flow, Functions, and Modules

Master decision-making and reusable code constructs in Python. You’ll learn how to write functions, organize code into modules, and handle errors gracefully.

**Topics covered:**

- Implement conditionals (if, elif, else) and loops (for, while)
- Define and call functions with parameters and return values
- Organize code using Python modules and import statements
- Handle exceptions using try/except blocks

---

### Module 3: Core Data Structures and File Handling

Learn to store and manipulate collections of data efficiently, and practice reading from and writing to common file formats.

**Topics covered:**

- Work with lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries
- Use list comprehensions for concise data processing
- Read and write CSV and text files using built-in file I/O
- Parse and generate JSON data

---

### Module 4: Numerical Computing with NumPy

Dive into numerical arrays and vectorized operations for high-performance computing. You’ll explore how NumPy underpins many data science workflows.

**Topics covered:**

- Create and reshape NumPy arrays
- Perform arithmetic operations and Boolean indexing
- Apply broadcasting rules for element-wise computations
- Use common statistical functions (mean, median, std)

---

### Module 5: Data Manipulation with pandas

Use pandas to load, clean, and transform tabular data. You’ll gain hands-on experience with DataFrame operations and real-world dataset handling.

**Topics covered:**

- Load and inspect data with pandas read_csv and head/tail
- Filter, sort, and slice DataFrames
- Handle missing values (dropna, fillna) and data types
- Group data and perform aggregation with groupby

---

### Module 6: Data Visualization and Exploratory Analysis

Create insightful visualizations and perform basic statistical analyses. You’ll learn to reveal patterns and relationships in your data.

**Topics covered:**

- Plot line, bar, and histogram charts with Matplotlib
- Customize plot styles, labels, and legends
- Use Seaborn for statistical plots like boxplots and heatmaps
- Compute and visualize descriptive statistics and correlations

---

### Module 7: Introduction to Machine Learning with scikit-learn

Get started with simple machine learning workflows. You’ll build, train, and evaluate basic models using scikit-learn.

**Topics covered:**

- Split data into training and test sets
- Implement linear regression for prediction tasks
- Train a k-nearest neighbors classifier for categorical data
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy and RMSE
