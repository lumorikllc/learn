## Learning Path

### Module 1: Setting Up Your Environment & JavaScript Essentials

Install and configure the tools you need to start React development, and get a quick refresher on modern JavaScript features. This step ensures your machine is ready and you’re comfortable with the language fundamentals React relies on.

**Topics covered:**

- Install Node.js, npm, and a code editor (VS Code)
- Create your first React app using Create React App
- ES6 syntax: let/const, arrow functions, template literals
- Modules and imports/exports in JavaScript
- Debugging JavaScript in the browser console

---

### Module 2: React Core Concepts: JSX, Elements & Components

Learn how React represents UI with JSX and converts it to real DOM elements. Begin crafting your own functional components and understand how React renders and updates the view.

**Topics covered:**

- Write JSX and embed JavaScript expressions
- Render React elements to the DOM with ReactDOM
- Create and use functional components
- Understand component vs HTML attributes
- Use Babel for transpiling JSX

---

### Module 3: Passing Data: Props & Component Composition

Discover how data flows through your app by passing props into components. Practice composing simple components into complex UIs and learn patterns for organizing reusable pieces.

**Topics covered:**

- Pass and access props in child components
- Set defaultProps and validate with propTypes
- Compose components using children and nesting
- Extract common UI elements into reusable components
- Pass callback functions as props for interactivity

---

### Module 4: Managing State & Effects

Handle dynamic data by adding state to your components and responding to lifecycle events. Transition from class-based state/lifecycle methods to modern Hooks for a cleaner approach.

**Topics covered:**

- Use the useState Hook for local component state
- Perform side effects with useEffect and cleanup
- Understand class component lifecycle: componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate
- Update state immutably and batch updates
- Manage multiple state variables in a single component

---

### Module 5: Events, Forms & User Input

Make your UI interactive by handling events and building forms. Learn controlled vs uncontrolled components and implement form validation for real-world data entry.

**Topics covered:**

- Attach event handlers for clicks, keyboard, and more
- Build controlled form components using state
- Validate input with custom validation logic
- Handle form submission and prevent default behavior
- Use refs for uncontrolled form inputs

---

### Module 6: Client-Side Routing with React Router

Turn your single-page React app into a multi-page experience with client-side routing. Learn to define routes, navigate between views, and handle dynamic URL parameters.

**Topics covered:**

- Install and set up React Router
- Define Routes and render components by path
- Use Link and NavLink for navigation
- Create dynamic routes with URL parameters
- Implement redirects and 404 NotFound pages

---

### Module 7: Global State & Context API

Move beyond local component state by introducing global state management. Start with React’s Context API to share data across your app without prop drilling.

**Topics covered:**

- Create and provide a Context for global data
- Consume Context values in nested components
- Update Context state from consumer components
- Organize Context logic into custom Hooks
- Compare Context API with Redux basics

---

### Module 8: Building, Testing & Deploying a Real-World App

Consolidate all your React skills by building a complete application from scratch. Learn how to test components, optimize performance, and deploy your app to a hosting platform.

**Topics covered:**

- Plan project structure and component hierarchy
- Write unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library
- Optimize build output for production
- Deploy to Netlify or Vercel with continuous deployment
- Set up basic CI/CD workflows
