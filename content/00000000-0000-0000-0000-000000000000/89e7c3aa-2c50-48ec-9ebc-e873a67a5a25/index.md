## Learning Path

### Module 1: Python Programming Fundamentals

Establish a solid Python foundation by covering core syntax, data handling, and project setup. This step ensures you can write clean, modular code before diving into web development.

**Topics covered:**

- [Python syntax and control flow ðŸ“–](https://lumorikllc.github.io/learn/content/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/2b95e07c-dc78-418c-8f77-b47b15934f3a)
- Built-in data structures (lists, dicts, sets)
- Defining and calling functions
- Creating virtual environments with venv
- Installing packages with pip

---

### Module 2: Web Concepts and HTTP Basics

Understand how the web works, learn key HTTP concepts, and get familiar with the tools and languages that power web pages. This knowledge is crucial for effective Flask development.

**Topics covered:**

- Client-server architecture and HTTP request/response
- Common HTTP methods and status codes
- Intro to HTML structure and basic CSS
- Using browser developer tools
- URL routing principles

---

### Module 3: Getting Started with Flask

Set up your first Flask application and learn how to configure routes, render templates, and serve static content. Youâ€™ll build a minimal web app as your hands-on introduction.

**Topics covered:**

- Installing Flask and project structure
- Defining routes and view functions
- Rendering templates with Jinja2
- Serving CSS, JavaScript, and images
- Configuring debug mode

---

### Module 4: Handling User Input with Forms

Learn to capture and validate user input through HTML forms. Youâ€™ll add interactive features to your app and provide feedback using built-in Flask tools.

**Topics covered:**

- Creating HTML forms and form fields
- Processing GET vs. POST requests
- Validating data with WTForms
- Displaying flash messages
- Implementing CSRF protection

---

### Module 5: Database Integration and ORM

Persist data in your web app by integrating a database using SQLAlchemy. Youâ€™ll define models, run migrations, and perform CRUD operations seamlessly.

**Topics covered:**

- Configuring Flask-SQLAlchemy
- Defining models and relationships
- Running migrations with Flask-Migrate
- Creating, reading, updating, deleting records
- Querying and filtering data

---

### Module 6: Authentication and Authorization

Secure your application by adding user registration and login functionality. Implement role-based access control to protect sensitive routes.

**Topics covered:**

- Setting up Flask-Login for user sessions
- Registering users and hashing passwords
- Implementing login and logout views
- Restricting routes with login_required
- Managing user roles and permissions

---

### Module 7: Advanced Structuring and Deployment

Organize your code for scalability, expose APIs, and deploy your app to a cloud service. Gain confidence releasing real web applications into production.

**Topics covered:**

- Structuring apps with Blueprints
- Building RESTful API endpoints
- Configuring environment variables
- Writing basic unit tests
- Deploying to Heroku (or similar)
