## Learning Path

### 📝 Module 1: Diagnostic Kickoff & Study Plan

Begin with a quick diagnostic to pinpoint strengths and weaknesses across all topics, then build a time-blocked loop schedule for the next 48 hours. This sets a clear roadmap for focused practice.

**Topics covered:**

- [Complete a 30-minute timed diagnostic covering key FE subjects 📖](https://lumorikllc.github.io/learn/content/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/92e41509-8c3a-4804-a851-dd99ae34dce5)
- Analyze results to identify top three weak areas
- Rank topics by error frequency and allotted study time
- Draft a detailed 48-hour loop schedule with study and rest blocks

---

### 📐 Module 2: Statics & Applied Math Loop

Cycle through core statics problems alongside essential math tools. Time‐boxed loops solidify equilibrium methods and mathematical techniques.

**Topics covered:**

- Solve 5 rigid‐body equilibrium problems with different support types
- Draw and interpret shear/moment diagrams for beams
- Perform vector operations and coordinate transformations
- Refresh calculus: derivatives/integrals in engineering contexts
- Solve 2×2 linear systems and basic differential equations

---

### ⚙️ Module 3: Dynamics & Fluid Mechanics Loop

Alternate between dynamics and fluid mechanics to reinforce kinematics, kinetics, and fluid behavior. Use repeated problem sets to enhance formula recall.

**Topics covered:**

- Apply Newton’s second law to particle and rigid‐body dynamics scenarios
- Use energy and impulse‐momentum equations for motion analysis
- Review fluid properties and hydrostatic pressure calculations
- Practice continuity and Bernoulli equation problems
- Compute simple pipe flow losses with Darcy–Weisbach

---

### 🔥 Module 4: Thermodynamics & Materials Loop

Integrate thermodynamics principles with materials science essentials. Loop through heat‐work analysis and material property problems for retention.

**Topics covered:**

- Analyze ideal and real gas processes (isothermal, adiabatic)
- Calculate work and heat transfer in open/closed systems
- Apply first and second laws to engineering cycles
- Interpret stress-strain curves and yield criteria
- Solve basic conduction and convection heat transfer problems

---

### 🎯 Module 5: Mock Exam & Targeted Review

Simulate exam conditions with a full‐length mock, then loop back to address mistakes. Focus on pacing, question strategy, and error correction.

**Topics covered:**

- Complete a 4-hour FE-style practice exam under timed conditions
- Review incorrect responses and categorize error types
- Revisit formulas and concepts for weak areas
- Practice 10 high-yield problem types in rapid succession
- Adjust time allocation based on mock performance

---

### 🧘 Module 6: Exam Readiness Rituals & Final Calm-Down

Implement pre-exam routines, mental preparation, and quick‐review rituals. Ensure a calm, confident mindset entering the test.

**Topics covered:**

- Prepare exam‐day checklist (ID, handbook, snacks)
- Practice breathing exercises and positive visualization
- Review a one-page formula summary
- Plan break, hydration, and snack schedule during exam
- Set time‐management checkpoints and affirmations
