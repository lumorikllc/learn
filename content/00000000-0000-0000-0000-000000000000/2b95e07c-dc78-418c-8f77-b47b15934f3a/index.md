## Chapter Overview

Python’s clear syntax and robust control flow constructs make it a powerful tool for automating tasks, analyzing data, and building web applications. Mastering these foundations ensures your code is readable, maintainable, and behaves as expected.

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Identify and use basic Python syntax elements, including correct indentation and statements.  
- Implement conditional logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else` constructs.  
- Construct and employ loops (`for` and `while`) to iterate over data sequences.  

## Key Concepts & Definitions

- **Syntax**: The set of rules defining valid code structure in a programming language.  
- **Statement**: A single line of code that performs an action (e.g., assignment, function call).  
- **Expression**: A combination of values and operators evaluated to produce another value.  
- **Variable**: A name referring to a value stored in memory.  
- **Indentation**: Leading whitespace that groups statements into blocks in Python.  
- **Block**: A group of statements sharing the same indentation level.  
- **Control flow**: The order in which individual statements and blocks are executed.  
- **Conditional**: A control-flow statement that runs code based on a boolean test.  
- **Loop**: A control-flow statement that repeats a block while a condition holds or over a sequence.  
- **Iteration**: One pass through the block of a loop.

These concepts work together: syntax rules define how to write statements and expressions. Variables hold data that expressions compute. Indentation groups statements into blocks that form conditionals and loops, controlling how and when code executes (control flow).

## Main Exposition

### 3.1 Python Syntax Fundamentals
Python emphasizes readability.  
- **Comments** begin with `#` and extend to the end of the line.  
- **Statements** end at a newline; no semicolons are required.  
- **Indentation** (typically 4 spaces) defines blocks. Mixing tabs and spaces raises an error.
  
Example:
```python
# This is a comment
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
```

### 3.2 Variables and Expressions
Assign values using `=`. Expressions combine variables, literals, and operators.
```python
a = 3
b = 4
c = a + b * 2   # Multiplication before addition
print(c)        # Outputs 11
```
Use parentheses to override precedence: `c = (a + b) * 2`.

### 3.3 Conditional Statements
Control flow based on tests returning `True` or `False`.
```python
score = 75
if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
else:
    grade = "D or F"
print(f"Grade: {grade}")
```
- `if` tests the first condition.  
- `elif` (else if) tests additional conditions.  
- `else` catches all remaining cases.

### 3.4 Loops and Iteration
#### `for` loops
Iterate over sequences (lists, strings, ranges):
```python
for i in range(1, 5):    # i takes values 1,2,3,4
    print(i)
```
#### `while` loops
Repeat while a condition holds:
```python
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print("Looping:", count)
    count += 1
```
Use `break` to exit early and `continue` to skip to the next iteration.

## Applications & Real-World Context

### Scenario 1: Validating User Input in a Console App
Imagine a console-based survey that asks users for their age. You must ensure the input is numeric and within a valid range. Using a `while` loop, you repeatedly prompt until the user enters a valid integer between 0 and 120. Inside the loop, an `if` statement checks `age.isdigit()` and the numeric range; invalid entries trigger an error message and a loop continuation. Once valid, the loop exits, and you proceed to greet the user. This control-flow pattern ensures robust handling of unpredictable user input, preventing your program from crashing on unexpected values.

### Scenario 2: Automating File Renaming
A marketing team needs to rename dozens of image files with a consistent prefix (e.g., `campaign1_`). Using a `for` loop, your script iterates over all filenames in a directory (`os.listdir`). Inside the loop, you construct a new filename by concatenating the prefix and original name, then call `os.rename(old, new)`. An `if` statement can skip non-image files by checking file extensions. This simple control-flow structure turns a tedious manual task into a one-step automated operation, saving hours of work and eliminating human error.

## Common Misconceptions & Pitfalls

- Mixing tabs and spaces  
  Correction: Always use spaces (PEP 8 recommends 4) to avoid indentation errors.

- Using `=` instead of `==` in conditionals  
  Correction: `=` assigns; `==` compares. Python disallows assignment in `if` conditions.

- Infinite loops with `while True:`  
  Correction: Ensure a `break` condition or update the loop variable inside the loop.

- Off-by-one errors in `range()`  
  Correction: Remember that `range(start, stop)` excludes `stop`. Use `range(1, n+1)` for 1…n.

- Modifying a list while iterating  
  Correction: Iterate over a copy (`for x in my_list[:]`) or build a new list.

## Worked Example Problem

**Problem:**  
Write a Python script that reads a list of scores (0–100) and prints each score’s letter grade (`A`,`B`,`C`,`D`,`F`). Use the standard cutoffs: A ≥ 90, B ≥ 80, C ≥ 70, D ≥ 60, otherwise F. Finally, print “Done” when all grades are processed.

**Solution:**
1. **Define the list of scores.**  
   ```python
   scores = [95, 82, 67, 58, 100]
   ```
   Commentary: We start with known test data.

2. **Iterate using a `for` loop.**  
   ```python
   for score in scores:
   ```
   Commentary: Loops through each integer in `scores`.

3. **Use conditionals to assign grades.**  
   ```python
       if score >= 90:
           grade = "A"
       elif score >= 80:
           grade = "B"
       elif score >= 70:
           grade = "C"
       elif score >= 60:
           grade = "D"
       else:
           grade = "F"
   ```
   Commentary: Checks highest to lowest thresholds.

4. **Print the result.**  
   ```python
       print(f"Score {score}: Grade {grade}")
   ```
   Commentary: Reports each mapping.

5. **After the loop, print completion.**  
   ```python
   print("Done")
   ```
   Commentary: Signals end of processing.

Full script:
```python
scores = [95, 82, 67, 58, 100]
for score in scores:
    if score >= 90:
        grade = "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        grade = "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        grade = "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        grade = "D"
    else:
        grade = "F"
    print(f"Score {score}: Grade {grade}")
print("Done")
```

## Practice Exercises

Q1. Explain why Python uses indentation instead of braces for blocks.  
Q2. What is printed by the following code?
```python
x = 5
if x > 3:
    print("High")
else:
    print("Low")
```
Q3. Write a `for` loop that prints even numbers from 2 to 10 inclusive.  
Q4. Suppose `n = 3`. What sequence does `range(1, n*2, 3)` generate?  
Q5. Draft a `while` loop that multiplies a variable `product` by 2 until it exceeds 100.  

## Summary & Further Reading

- Python enforces **indentation** to define blocks clearly.  
- **Statements** perform actions; **expressions** compute values.  
- Use `if` / `elif` / `else` for conditional control flow.  
- Use `for` to iterate over sequences; `while` to loop on a condition.  
- Always include a condition change or `break` to avoid infinite loops.  
- Test edge cases like empty lists or unexpected input values.

## Solutions

A1. Indentation enforces readability and reduces syntactic clutter; it visually aligns code blocks without braces.  
A2. Prints:
```
High
```  
A3.
```python
for i in range(2, 11, 2):
    print(i)
```  
A4. With `n = 3`, `range(1, n*2, 3)` is `range(1, 6, 3)`, generating `[1, 4]`.  
A5.
```python
product = 1
while product <= 100:
    product *= 2
```
