## Learning Path

### üß† Module 1: Foundations of AI Engineering

Understand the role of an AI Engineer, core AI/ML concepts, and the essential skills and tools required to begin your journey.

**Topics covered:**

- Define the responsibilities and scope of an AI Engineer
- Differentiate between machine learning, deep learning, and data science
- Review essential mathematics: linear algebra, probability, and statistics
- Set up a Python environment and key ML libraries (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn)
- Map out the end-to-end ML pipeline (data collection to deployment)

---

### ü§ñ Module 2: Leveraging Pre-trained Models

Learn how to discover, load, and use pre-trained models for common tasks, and perform simple fine-tuning to adapt them to custom data.

**Topics covered:**

- Explore model hubs (Hugging Face) and select suitable transformers
- Load tokenizers and models for inference pipelines
- Perform zero-shot and few-shot learning with pre-trained LLMs
- Fine-tune a text classification model on a small dataset
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall

---

### üîå Module 3: Working with AI APIs

Gain hands-on experience calling AI services via APIs like OpenAI‚Äôs, mastering prompt engineering, authentication, and usage best practices.

**Topics covered:**

- Register for API access, handle keys and environment variables securely
- Write code to call completion and chat endpoints
- Craft effective prompts and use temperature, max tokens, and system messages
- Implement error handling, rate-limit logic, and retries
- Monitor cost, usage metrics, and optimize for efficiency

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è Module 4: Ethics, Safety, and Responsible AI

Explore the ethical considerations around AI systems, learn to identify bias, ensure privacy, and build transparent, fair models.

**Topics covered:**

- Identify potential sources of bias in datasets and models
- Apply fairness metrics (demographic parity, equal opportunity)
- Implement data anonymization and privacy best practices (GDPR)
- Design for explainability and transparency
- Mitigate adversarial inputs and unsafe outputs

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Module 5: Open-Source Tools and Frameworks

Master the key open-source libraries and frameworks for building, training, and deploying AI models efficiently.

**Topics covered:**

- Use Hugging Face Transformers and Datasets for model training
- Leverage Accelerate or DeepSpeed for distributed training
- Build end-to-end pipelines with LangChain or Haystack
- Explore open-source LLMs (LLaMA, Mistral, Falcon) and local deployment
- Containerize models with Docker and Kubernetes

---

### üì¶ Module 6: Embeddings and Vector Databases

Dive into embeddings for semantic search, learn to store and query vectors, and build fast similarity search applications.

**Topics covered:**

- Generate embeddings using OpenAI or SentenceTransformers
- Understand vector database concepts: indexing, distance metrics
- Set up and query FAISS, Pinecone, or Weaviate
- Optimize index parameters (IVF, HNSW) for performance
- Evaluate retrieval quality with precision@k and recall@k

---

### üöÄ Module 7: Retrieval-Augmented Generation & Production

Integrate retrieval systems with LLMs to build RAG pipelines, then deploy and monitor your AI applications in production.

**Topics covered:**

- Chunk and vectorize documents for RAG
- Combine retrieval with generative models in a unified pipeline
- Implement end-to-end service with REST or gRPC
- Deploy with Docker, CI/CD, and cloud services
- Monitor performance, logs, and set up alerts for drift and errors
