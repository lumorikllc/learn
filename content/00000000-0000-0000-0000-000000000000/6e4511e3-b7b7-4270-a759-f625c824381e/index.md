## Chapter Overview

Chain-of-thought reasoning transforms opaque language-model outputs into transparent sequences of intermediate steps. By encouraging GPT-5 to “think aloud,” we gain insight into its internal logic and improve reliability on complex tasks.

Learning Goals  
- Define **chain-of-thought reasoning** and its role in large language models  
- Explain how explicit reasoning traces enhance model **interpretability**  
- Craft prompts that reliably elicit chain-of-thought from GPT-5

## Key Concepts & Definitions

**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: A sequence of intermediate reasoning steps the model generates before producing a final answer.  
**Prompt Engineering**: The art of designing input text that guides model behavior.  
**Transparency**: The quality of making internal processes visible to users.  
**Interpretability**: The ease with which a human can understand a model’s decision process.  
**Latent Reasoning Steps**: Unspoken internal states or computations the model uses to arrive at an answer.  
**Self-Consistency**: An ensemble technique sampling multiple reasoning traces and selecting the most frequent answer.  
**Few-Shot Prompting**: Including examples in the prompt to demonstrate desired reasoning patterns.  
**Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought**: Eliciting reasoning by template rather than examples, e.g., “Let’s think step by step.”

These concepts interrelate: prompt engineering shapes how GPT-5 reveals its latent reasoning steps (chain-of-thought), which in turn boosts transparency and interpretability. Techniques like self-consistency further refine the reliability of those explicit traces.

## Main Exposition

### 1. Theory of Chain-of-Thought  
Humans often solve problems by breaking them into smaller steps (“think aloud”). GPT-5 mimics this by generating tokens that articulate sub-conclusions. Sequencing tokens into coherent “thoughts” helps both model and user track complex inferences.

### 2. Mechanisms in GPT-5  
GPT-5’s transformer layers compute attention weights over prior tokens. When prompted for chain-of-thought, the model treats each intermediate statement as context, allowing deeper reasoning:

$$
P(\text{Answer}\mid\text{Question}) = \sum_{\text{trace}} P(\text{trace}\mid\text{Question})\,P(\text{Answer}\mid \text{trace},\text{Question}).
$$

Tokens in the “trace” are generated to maximize coherence and probability under the model’s parameters.

### 3. Prompt Techniques to Surface Reasoning  
- **Few-Shot CoT**: Provide 2–5 examples where each includes question, step-by-step reasoning, and answer.  
- **Zero-Shot CoT**: Use trigger phrases like “Let’s think through this step by step.”  
- **Structured Templates**:  
  ``` 
  Q: [Your question here]
  Let's think step by step:
  1.
  2.
  3. 
  ```
- **Self-Consistency**: Sample $n$ traces with temperature $>0$, then select the most common final answer.

### 4. Evaluating Chain-of-Thought  
- **Correctness**: Does the chain lead to the right answer?  
- **Coherence**: Are steps logically ordered?  
- **Conciseness**: Are there no redundant statements?  
Scoring can be manual or automated by comparing each step to a reference solution.

## Applications & Real-World Context

**Scenario 1: Mathematical Proof Explanation**  
A student uses GPT-5 to prove that the sum of the first $n$ odd numbers is $n^2$. By eliciting a chain-of-thought, the model writes out base case verification, inductive hypothesis, and inductive step. The transparent reasoning helps the student follow each inference and spot errors.

**Scenario 2: Code Debugging Assistant**  
A developer pastes a Python function that fails edge-case tests. Prompted for chain-of-thought, GPT-5 enumerates possible causes—off-by-one errors, incorrect base conditions—and tests each hypothesis in pseudo-code. The stepwise analysis pinpoints the bug faster than a single final recommendation.

**Scenario 3: Medical Decision Support**  
A clinician asks GPT-5 for differential diagnoses given symptoms. By surfacing the chain-of-thought, the model lists symptom-to-disease reasoning: vital sign interpretation, risk factor mapping, and exclusion criteria. The rationale increases trust and enables peer review before decision-making.

## Common Misconceptions & Pitfalls

1. **“Chain-of-thought guarantees correctness.”**  
   Correction: Explicit reasoning can still contain logical errors; always verify each step.  
2. **“Longer chains are better.”**  
   Correction: Excessive detail may introduce noise. Aim for clarity and relevance.  
3. **“Chain-of-thought is deterministic.”**  
   Correction: With temperature sampling, multiple plausible traces may exist. Use self-consistency.  
4. **“Any prompt phrase works.”**  
   Correction: Triggers must be tested—some phrasing encourages verbosity without substance.

## Worked Example Problem

**Problem**  
“A farmer has a 3-kg apple bag, a 2-kg banana bag, and a mixed 1-kg bag. Each label is wrong. Determine contents of each bag.”

**Solution**  
1. Label the bags A: “Apples” (3 kg), B: “Bananas” (2 kg), C: “Mixed” (1 kg).  
2. Since A is labeled “Apples” but wrong, A is either bananas or mixed. It weighs 3 kg, so it cannot be mixed (1 kg). Thus A must be bananas.  
3. B is labeled “Bananas” but wrong. B weighs 2 kg, so it cannot be bananas. It must be mixed (1 kg) or apples (3 kg). But B’s weight is 2 kg, so the only 2 kg option is bananas—but that’s disallowed—so B must be mixed (1 kg).  
4. C is the remaining bag: apples.  

**Commentary**  
Stepwise elimination uses weight constraints and wrong-label information. Each inference narrows possibilities systematically.

## Solutions

**Q1.** A sequence of explicit intermediate steps generated by the model to reach a final answer.  
**Q2.**  
```
Q: What is 12 × 13?
Let’s think step by step:
1. 12 × 10 = 120
2. 12 × 3 = 36
3. Sum = 120 + 36
Answer: 156
```  
**Q3.** It aggregates multiple reasoning paths and selects the most frequent answer, reducing random errors.  
**Q4.** Correctness (leads to right answer) and coherence (logical flow without leaps).  
**Q5.**  
```
Example 1:
Q: If Alice is older than Bob, and Bob is older than Carol, who is youngest?
Solution:
1. Bob > Carol
2. Alice > Bob
3. So Carol is youngest.
Answer: Carol

Example 2:
Q: You have coins worth 1¢, 5¢, 10¢ that sum to 17¢ using exactly three coins. Find them.
Solution:
1. Try two dimes, one penny = 21¢ (too high)
2. Try one dime, one nickel, one penny = 16¢ (too low)
3. Try one dime, two pennies = 12¢ (too low)
4. Try one nickel, two pennies = 7¢ (too low)
5. Try three nickels = 15¢ (too low)
6. No combination works—error in assumptions.
