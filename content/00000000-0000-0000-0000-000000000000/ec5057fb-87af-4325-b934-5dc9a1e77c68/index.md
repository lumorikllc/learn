## Learning Path

### üêç Module 1: Programming & SQL Fundamentals

Establish a strong base in Python programming and SQL querying to manipulate and retrieve data effectively.

**Topics covered:**

- Understand Python data types, control flow, and functions
- Write and execute basic SQL DDL (CREATE, ALTER) and DML (SELECT, INSERT) statements
- Filter and sort query results using WHERE, ORDER BY, and LIMIT
- Perform basic aggregations with GROUP BY and HAVING
- Use Python to connect to a database and run simple SQL queries

---

### üßπ Module 2: Data Wrangling & Advanced Querying

Learn to clean, transform, and analyze data using Python libraries and advanced SQL techniques.

**Topics covered:**

- Clean and manipulate tabular data with Pandas (filtering, merging, reshaping)
- Write complex SQL joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) and subqueries
- Apply window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, SUM OVER) for advanced analytics
- Develop reusable Python scripts and functions for data processing
- Automate data loading and exporting with Python and SQL

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Module 3: Data Modeling & ETL Pipelines

Design efficient data models and build end-to-end ETL workflows to move and transform data.

**Topics covered:**

- Learn principles of relational and dimensional modeling (star, snowflake schemas)
- Design and document data models for analytical workloads
- Implement ETL jobs in Python to extract, transform, and load data
- Schedule and manage pipelines using Apache Airflow DAGs
- Monitor pipeline runs and handle errors with logging and alerts

---

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Module 4: Cloud Platforms & Scalable Storage

Leverage cloud services to store, process, and manage data at scale in AWS, GCP, or Azure.

**Topics covered:**

- Set up and configure object storage (S3, GCS, or Azure Blob)
- Deploy and manage relational databases (RDS, Cloud SQL, Azure SQL)
- Work with cloud data warehouses (Redshift, BigQuery, Synapse)
- Implement infrastructure-as-code with Terraform or CloudFormation
- Manage identity, access, and security in a cloud environment

---

### üíæ Module 5: Big Data Technologies

Explore distributed data processing frameworks to handle large-scale datasets.

**Topics covered:**

- Understand Hadoop ecosystem components (HDFS, YARN)
- Process big data with Apache Spark (RDDs vs DataFrames) using PySpark
- Optimize Spark jobs with partitioning, caching, and tuning
- Ingest streaming data with Apache Kafka or Kinesis
- Integrate Spark pipelines with cloud storage and data warehouses

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Module 6: Orchestration, DevOps & Best Practices

Implement production-grade data engineering practices, including CI/CD, containerization, and monitoring.

**Topics covered:**

- Containerize data jobs with Docker and manage images
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for data workflows (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- Use workflow orchestration tools beyond Airflow (Prefect, Dagster)
- Implement monitoring and alerting with Prometheus, Grafana, or Cloud-native tools
- Apply security best practices: encryption, secrets management, and compliance
