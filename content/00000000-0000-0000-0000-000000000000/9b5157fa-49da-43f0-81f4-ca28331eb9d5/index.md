## Learning Path

### 🖥️ Module 1: Hardware Foundations

Begin with the core components of modern PCs and peripherals to build a solid hardware foundation. Learn how to identify, install, and configure motherboards, CPUs, RAM, power supplies, and storage devices. This step ensures you can assemble and maintain reliable workstations.

**Topics covered:**

- [Identify motherboard form factors, chipsets, and expansion slots 📖](https://lumorikllc.github.io/learn/content/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/576b04ce-4c3e-4005-a2ae-f36bc37779d4)
- Install and configure RAM modules and storage drives (HDD, SSD, NVMe)
- Select and install appropriate CPU sockets, coolers, and thermal paste
- Configure power supply connectors and troubleshoot power delivery issues

---

### 💻 Module 2: Operating Systems and Troubleshooting

Dive into the installation, configuration, and maintenance of popular operating systems. Master Windows, Linux, and macOS environments, including virtualization basics. Develop systematic troubleshooting skills to diagnose and resolve hardware and software issues.

**Topics covered:**

- Install and configure Windows, Linux distributions, and macOS
- Use command-line tools (PowerShell, Bash) for diagnostics and automation
- Implement virtual machines and snapshots with VMware or VirtualBox
- Apply best practices for backups, recovery, and system updates
- Utilize troubleshooting methodologies (question, hypothesize, test, document)

---

### 🌐 Module 3: Networking Fundamentals

Cover the basic principles of networking, including the OSI and TCP/IP models, IP addressing, and common protocols. Learn to design and document network topologies and connect devices using proper cabling. This module lays the groundwork for more advanced Network+ and CCNA topics.

**Topics covered:**

- Explain OSI vs. TCP/IP models and map protocols to each layer
- Design and compare bus, star, ring, and mesh topologies
- Configure IPv4 addressing, subnet masks, and perform subnetting calculations
- Distinguish key protocols: TCP, UDP, DNS, DHCP, ARP
- Select and terminate network cables (Cat5e, Cat6, fiber) and connectors

---

### 🔒 Module 4: Network Implementation and Security

Advance into device configuration, VLAN segmentation, and basic security measures. Set up and secure small to medium networks with switches, routers, and wireless access points. Troubleshoot connectivity and implement policies to protect network assets.

**Topics covered:**

- Configure Cisco/managed switches and assign VLANs
- Implement inter-VLAN routing using routers or Layer 3 switches
- Apply ACLs, port security, and network access control (NAC)
- Set up and secure wireless networks (WPA2/WPA3, SSID management)
- Troubleshoot network connectivity with ping, traceroute, and packet capture

---

### 📶 Module 5: CCNA Switching and Wireless Essentials

Focus on Cisco-specific switching concepts and wireless fundamentals critical for CCNA. Learn Spanning Tree Protocol, EtherChannel, and advanced switch features. Configure and secure wireless LAN deployments to prepare for real-world scenarios.

**Topics covered:**

- Configure VTP, DTP, and switchport modes on Cisco switches
- Implement Spanning Tree Protocol variants (PVST+, RSTP)
- Set up EtherChannel bundles for redundancy and load balancing
- Manage wireless controllers and lightweight access points
- Secure wireless networks with EAP, 802.1X, and RADIUS integration

---

### 🚦 Module 6: CCNA Routing and WAN Technologies

Delve into dynamic routing protocols and WAN connectivity using Cisco devices. Understand OSPF, EIGRP, IPv6, and site-to-site VPNs. Build skills to design scalable networks with reliable inter-site communication.

**Topics covered:**

- Configure static, default, and dynamic routes (EIGRP, OSPF)
- Implement IPv6 addressing, ACLs, and routing protocols
- Set up site-to-site VPNs and GRE tunnels
- Configure and troubleshoot WAN links (Frame Relay, MPLS, PPP)
- Analyze routing tables and use debug commands safely

---

### 📝 Module 7: CCNA Advanced Topics and Exam Readiness

Wrap up your journey with advanced automation, security, and QoS concepts. Practice end-to-end network deployments and refine hands-on troubleshooting. Finalize your preparation with lab simulations and targeted practice exams to ensure CCNA success.

**Topics covered:**

- Implement network automation basics using Python and REST APIs
- Configure ACLs, zone-based firewalls, and secure management plane
- Apply QoS policies for traffic prioritization and bandwidth control
- Complete full-scale lab scenarios with packet tracer or physical gear
- Take timed practice exams and review common CCNA question formats
