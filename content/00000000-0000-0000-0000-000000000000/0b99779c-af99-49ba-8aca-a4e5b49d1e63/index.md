## Chapter Overview

Understanding transformer architecture is foundational for mastering modern large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval‐Augmented Generation (RAG). Transformers power state‐of‐the‐art applications—from translation to conversational agents—thanks to their efficient attention mechanisms and scalability.

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Describe the core components of a transformer (self‐attention, multi‐head attention, positional encoding, feedforward layers).
- Derive and explain the self‐attention mechanism mathematically.
- Identify how scaling transformers (depth, width, heads) impacts model capabilities.

## Key Concepts & Definitions

**Transformer**  
A neural network architecture using attention mechanisms to relate all input tokens simultaneously.

**Self‐Attention**  
A mechanism computing token representations by weighting all other tokens in a sequence.

**Multi‐Head Attention**  
Parallel self‐attention layers (heads) capturing different representation subspaces.

**Positional Encoding**  
Sinusoidal or learned vectors adding order information to token embeddings.

**Feedforward Network**  
A two‐layer fully connected sublayer applied identically to each position.

**Layer Normalization**  
A normalization step stabilizing training by standardizing activations within each layer.

**Encoder**  
The transformer block processing input sequences into continuous representations.

**Decoder**  
The transformer block generating output sequences while attending to encoder outputs.

These concepts interlock: an **encoder** stack alternates **self‐attention**, **feedforward**, and **layer normalization**, enriched by **positional encoding**. The **decoder** adds cross‐attention to encoder outputs. Multiple **attention heads** in **multi‐head attention** allow the model to focus on diverse relationships simultaneously.

## Main Exposition

### 1. Self‐Attention Mechanism

Self‐attention computes each token’s representation by mixing information from all tokens:
1. Project input embeddings $X\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ into queries $Q$, keys $K$, and values $V$:
   $$
   Q = XW_Q,\quad K = XW_K,\quad V = XW_V
   $$
2. Compute scaled dot‐product attention:
   $$
   \mathrm{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \mathrm{softmax}\Bigl(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\Bigr)V.
   $$
Here, $d_k$ is the key dimension. The softmax weights how much each token attends to others.

### 2. Multi‐Head Attention

Rather than a single attention, transformers use $h$ parallel heads:
$$
\mathrm{head}_i = \mathrm{Attention}(QW_{Q_i},\,KW_{K_i},\,VW_{V_i})\quad(i=1,\dots,h).
$$
Concatenate heads and project:
$$
\mathrm{MultiHead}(Q,K,V) = \mathrm{Concat}(\mathrm{head}_1,\dots,\mathrm{head}_h)\,W_O.
$$
Each head learns distinct relational patterns.

### 3. Positional Encoding & Feedforward Layers

Transformers lack recurrence, so positional encodings $P\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ add token order:
$$
\text{PE}_{(pos,2i)} = \sin\bigl(pos/10000^{2i/d}\bigr),\quad
\text{PE}_{(pos,2i+1)} = \cos\bigl(pos/10000^{2i/d}\bigr).
$$
After attention, a position‐wise feedforward sublayer applies:
$$
\mathrm{FFN}(x) = \max(0, xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2.
$$

### 4. Encoder‐Decoder Structure

An encoder stack repeats:
1. Multi‐head self‐attention  
2. Add & Layer Norm  
3. Feedforward  
4. Add & Layer Norm  

A decoder stack adds a third sublayer—encoder‐decoder attention—between self‐attention and feedforward. This enables the decoder to attend to encoder representations when generating outputs.

## Applications & Real‐World Context

**1. Machine Translation**  
In translation, the encoder reads a source sentence (“I love AI”) and produces contextual embeddings. The decoder generates the target sentence (“J’adore l’IA”) token by token, using self‐attention to maintain fluency and cross‐attention to align with source words. Transformers replaced RNN‐based models by processing sequences in parallel, drastically reducing training time and improving translation quality.

**2. Text Summarization**  
To summarize an article, the encoder ingests long passages and computes global attention maps, identifying key points across sentences. The decoder then produces a concise summary, attending both to previously generated summary tokens (self‐attention) and the encoder’s article representation (cross‐attention). Large transformer‐based summarizers (e.g., BART, T5) achieve human‐competitive performance by leveraging this architecture.

**3. Retrieval‐Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
In RAG, a transformer generator integrates retrieved documents. First, a retriever selects relevant passages. Then, the transformer encoder processes query plus retrieved text, and the decoder generates an answer grounded in external knowledge. Self‐attention across combined contexts ensures factual consistency and fluency, making RAG systems excel in open‐domain question answering.

## Common Misconceptions & Pitfalls

1. “Attention replaces all recurrence.”  
   Correction: Transformers remove recurrence but still rely on positional encodings to model sequence order.

2. “More heads always improve performance.”  
   Correction: Excessive heads can lead to redundancy and inefficient training; head count should match model scale.

3. “Deeper models always generalize better.”  
   Correction: Beyond a point, deeper transformers face optimization challenges and diminishing returns without more data.

4. “Positional encoding dimension equals model dimension.”  
   Correction: While often true, alternative learned embeddings may use different dimensions or share parameters.

## Worked Example Problem

**Problem:**  
Given token embeddings $X = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{bmatrix}$, weight matrices  
$W_Q = W_K = W_V = I_{2\times2}$, compute the self‐attention output.

**Solution:**

1. Compute $Q=K=V=X$:
   $$
   Q = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{bmatrix},\quad
   K = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{bmatrix},\quad
   V = Q.
   $$
2. Compute $QK^T$:
   $$
   QK^T = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{bmatrix}
          \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{bmatrix}
        = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{bmatrix}.
   $$
3. Scale by $\sqrt{d_k} = \sqrt{2}$ and apply softmax row‐wise:
   $$
   \frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{2}} = 
   \begin{bmatrix}1/\sqrt{2} & 0\\0 & 1/\sqrt{2}\end{bmatrix},\quad
   \mathrm{softmax}\bigl(\cdot\bigr) = \begin{bmatrix}0.62 & 0.38\\0.38 & 0.62\end{bmatrix}.
   $$
4. Multiply by $V$:
   $$
   \mathrm{Output} 
   = \begin{bmatrix}0.62 & 0.38\\0.38 & 0.62\end{bmatrix}
     \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{bmatrix}
   = \begin{bmatrix}0.62 & 0.38\\0.38 & 0.62\end{bmatrix}.
   $$

Commentary: Each token mixes itself (0.62) and the other token (0.38), illustrating how self‐attention blends information.
