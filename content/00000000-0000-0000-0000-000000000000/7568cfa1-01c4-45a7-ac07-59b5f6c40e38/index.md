## Learning Path

### 🏗️ Module 1: Foundations of AWS Data Engineering

Establish a solid base in AWS core services and principles vital for a data engineer. You’ll learn identity management, networking essentials, and compute options to run data workloads securely and efficiently.

**Topics covered:**

- Explain AWS global infrastructure and shared responsibility model
- Configure IAM roles, policies, and user groups for data workflows
- Design VPC subnets, routing tables, and security groups
- Launch EC2 instances and author Lambda functions for data tasks

---

### 🗄️ Module 2: Data Storage & Database Solutions

Dive into AWS storage and database services tailored for diverse data types. You’ll compare managed options, implement best practices, and optimize schemas for performance and cost.

**Topics covered:**

- Architect S3 buckets with versioning, lifecycle rules, and encryption
- Differentiate S3 storage classes, Glacier, and data archiving strategies
- Design normalized schemas in Amazon RDS and non-relational models in DynamoDB
- Provision Redshift clusters and optimize distribution styles and sort keys

---

### 📡 Module 3: Data Ingestion & Messaging Pipelines

Learn to ingest and transport data at scale using streaming, batch, and bulk methods. You’ll build resilient pipelines with AWS messaging and transfer services, ensuring near-real-time and offline workflows.

**Topics covered:**

- Implement real-time data ingestion with Kinesis Data Streams and Firehose
- Configure decoupled architectures using Amazon SQS and SNS
- Use AWS DataSync and Snowball for large-scale, offline transfers
- Monitor ingestion pipelines with CloudWatch metrics and alarms

---

### 📊 Module 4: Data Processing & Analytics

Transform, analyze, and visualize data using AWS analytics tools. You’ll orchestrate ETL jobs, run big data frameworks, query data lakes, and build dashboards for insights.

**Topics covered:**

- Create ETL workflows with AWS Glue crawlers, jobs, and the Data Catalog
- Process massive datasets on Amazon EMR with Apache Spark
- Run serverless queries in Athena and optimize performance
- Develop interactive visualizations in Amazon QuickSight

---

### 🔒 Module 5: Security, Monitoring & Cost Optimization

Fortify your data environment by applying security best practices, tracking operations, and managing budgets. Gain hands-on skills to encrypt, audit, and tune your data solutions.

**Topics covered:**

- Implement encryption at rest and in transit using AWS KMS and SSE
- Configure CloudTrail for governance, risk, and compliance auditing
- Build CloudWatch dashboards, alarms, and log insights for observability
- Analyze costs with AWS Cost Explorer and optimize resource usage

---

### 🎯 Module 6: Exam Readiness & Practice

Consolidate your knowledge by reviewing exam objectives, tackling practice questions, and performing hands-on labs. You’ll refine test-taking strategies and fill gaps ahead of the DEA-C01 exam.

**Topics covered:**

- Map AWS services and features to the DEA-C01 exam blueprint
- Complete timed practice exams and analyze incorrect answers
- Study key AWS whitepapers and FAQs for data engineering
- Perform guided labs and mini-projects in the AWS console
