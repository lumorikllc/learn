## Learning Path

### 🧠 Module 1: Foundations of LLM Internals & Interpretability

Get grounded in the core architecture of large language models and the key principles of interpretability. You’ll learn how transformer layers process information and survey common techniques for probing hidden representations.

**Topics covered:**

- [Dissecting transformer blocks: embeddings, self-attention, and feed-forward networks 📖](https://lumorikllc.github.io/learn/content/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/9e328f99-3042-4cb2-a2d7-b676fb97410a)
- Understanding hidden states vs. feature activations
- Overview of interpretability methods: probing classifiers, attribution, and visualization
- Key metrics for evaluating interpretability

---

### 📚 Module 2: Dictionary Learning & Sparse Feature Representations

Explore how dictionary learning uncovers a sparse set of basis vectors (features) that explain neural activations. You’ll implement and analyze algorithms that extract human-interpretable patterns from vast activation spaces.

**Topics covered:**

- Principles of sparse coding and overcomplete dictionaries
- K-SVD and online dictionary learning algorithms
- Visualizing learned atoms and linking them to semantic concepts
- Hands-on implementation with Python (scikit-learn or custom)

---

### 🚀 Module 3: Deep Dive into Anthropic’s 34M Features (Claude Sonnet)

Study Anthropic’s breakthrough approach to mapping 34 million features in Claude Sonnet. You’ll dissect their methodology, data preparation, and the novelty behind their large-scale feature extraction.

**Topics covered:**

- Reading and summarizing the Claude Sonnet paper
- Reconstructing their feature extraction pipeline
- Scaling dictionary learning to tens of millions of features
- Comparing Anthropic’s results with prior interpretability studies

---

### 🛠️ Module 4: Feature Extraction, Manipulation & Inversion

Learn techniques to extract specific features, manipulate them in activation space, and invert them back to natural language or images. Master how interventions in feature space alter model behavior.

**Topics covered:**

- Projecting activations onto learned feature bases
- Activation editing: adding, removing, or amplifying features
- Inversion methods: mapping features back to tokens or pixels
- Evaluating behavioral changes after feature interventions

---

### 🌐 Module 5: Multimodal & Multilingual Feature Alignment

Extend your skills to align and analyze features across languages and modalities. You’ll explore cross-modal dictionaries and techniques for comparing representations in multilingual settings.

**Topics covered:**

- Constructing joint text-vision dictionaries
- Aligning token embeddings across multiple languages
- Cross-modal probing: linking visual concepts to textual features
- Case studies in translation and image captioning

---

### 🔒 Module 6: Safety Implications & Ethical Considerations

Investigate how feature-level insights inform model safety, robustness, and alignment. You’ll identify hidden toxic or adversarial features and explore governance frameworks for safe deployment.

**Topics covered:**

- Detecting and mitigating toxic features
- Feature-based adversarial attacks and defenses
- Role of interpretability in model alignment
- Policy and governance: best practices for transparency

---

### ⚙️ Module 7: Practical Applications & Tooling

Put your knowledge into practice with real-world case studies and open-source tools. You’ll build end-to-end pipelines for feature analysis, debiasing, and fine-tuning based on interpretable features.

**Topics covered:**

- Leveraging interpretability libraries (e.g., Captum, Ecco)
- Building a feature analysis workflow in Jupyter
- Case study: debiasing gender and ethnicity features
- Integrating feature-based insights into fine-tuning
