## Learning Path

### Module 1: Kubernetes Fundamentals and Environment Setup

Begin with the core concepts of container orchestration and set up a local Kubernetes environment. Youâ€™ll learn how to interact with a cluster using kubectl and define basic workloads.

**Topics covered:**

- [Principles of containers and orchestration ðŸ“–](https://lumorikllc.github.io/learn/content/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/6c7d157e-5a7f-4d55-9a8f-ff4f4917c907)
- Installing Minikube/Kind or K3s for local clusters
- kubectl commands: get, describe, apply, delete
- Pod, Node, and Namespace concepts
- Writing simple YAML resource definitions

---

### Module 2: Deep Dive into Kubernetes Architecture

Explore the architecture that powers Kubernetes. Understand how control plane and node components collaborate to maintain the desired state and how data is stored securely.

**Topics covered:**

- Control plane components: kube-apiserver, etcd, scheduler, controller-manager
- Node components: kubelet, kube-proxy, container runtime
- Cluster communication and API requests flow
- etcd data model and backup/restore strategies
- High-availability control plane patterns

---

### Module 3: Workloads, Deployments, and Configuration Management

Manage application lifecycles using Deployments, ReplicaSets, and other controllers. Learn how to externalize configuration and handle secrets securely.

**Topics covered:**

- Deployment and ReplicaSet definitions
- Declarative updates, rollbacks, and rollouts
- StatefulSets and DaemonSets for specialized workloads
- ConfigMaps for configuration decoupling
- Secrets management and best practices

---

### Module 4: Networking and Traffic Management

Understand how pods communicate and expose services. Configure network policies, DNS resolution, and Ingress to control north-south and east-west traffic.

**Topics covered:**

- CNI plugins and pod-to-pod networking
- Service types: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer
- Kube-DNS/CoreDNS service discovery
- NetworkPolicy objects for traffic isolation
- Ingress controllers and basic routing rules

---

### Module 5: Storage and Persistent Data

Learn how Kubernetes handles persistent storage. Work with volumes, dynamic provisioning, and manage storage lifecycles for stateful applications.

**Topics covered:**

- PersistentVolumes (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC)
- StorageClasses and dynamic provisioning
- Common volume plugins (NFS, AWS EBS, GCE PersistentDisk)
- Volume access modes and reclaim policies
- Backup and restore strategies for persistent data

---

### Module 6: Security and Access Control

Secure your cluster by implementing role-based access control, network policies, and encryption. Ensure workloads and data remain protected.

**Topics covered:**

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) fundamentals
- Pod Security Admission and security contexts
- NetworkPolicy for network segmentation
- Encrypting secrets at rest and in transit
- Image security: scanning and runtime policies

---

### Module 7: Monitoring, Logging, and Cluster Maintenance

Set up observability to monitor cluster health and application performance. Learn best practices for logging, autoscaling, and cluster upgrades.

**Topics covered:**

- Metrics Server, Prometheus, and Grafana integration
- Centralized logging with EFK/ELK stacks
- Health probes: liveness and readiness checks
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and Vertical Pod Autoscaler
- Cluster upgrade and maintenance workflows

---

### Module 8: Advanced Topics: Operators and Service Mesh

Master Kubernetes extensibility with Operators and enhance service-to-service communication using a service mesh. Build scalable, automated patterns for complex applications.

**Topics covered:**

- CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) and API extensions
- Operator pattern and lifecycle management
- Building an Operator with the Operator SDK
- Service mesh fundamentals and use cases
- Istio basics: sidecar injection and traffic policies
