## Learning Path

### Module 1: Getting Started with Python

Set up your development environment and learn the basic building blocks of programming in Python. You’ll write your first scripts, explore simple data types, and perform basic operations.

**Topics covered:**

- Install Python, VS Code (or another IDE), and configure the REPL
- Write and run a “Hello, World!” script
- Understand variables, data types (int, float, str, bool)
- Perform basic arithmetic and string operations
- Use input() and print() for simple I/O

---

### Module 2: Control Flow & Data Structures

Learn how to direct the flow of your programs and manage collections of data effectively. You’ll use conditionals and loops alongside Python’s built-in data structures to solve real problems.

**Topics covered:**

- Write if, elif, and else statements for decision making
- Implement for and while loops to process repetitive tasks
- Work with lists: indexing, slicing, and common methods
- Use dictionaries and sets for key-value mapping and unique collections
- Apply list comprehensions for concise data transformations

---

### Module 3: Functions & Modular Programming

Discover how to structure code into reusable pieces. You’ll define your own functions, manage scope, and leverage Python modules to keep projects organized.

**Topics covered:**

- Define functions with parameters and return values
- Understand variable scope and lifetime (local vs global)
- Use Python’s built-in modules (e.g., math, datetime)
- Create your own modules and import them into scripts
- Document functions with docstrings and use help()

---

### Module 4: Algorithms & Core CS Concepts

Build a foundation in computer science by studying essential algorithms, complexity analysis, and recursive thinking. You’ll write and evaluate code for searching and sorting.

**Topics covered:**

- Analyze algorithm efficiency using Big O notation
- Implement linear and binary search algorithms
- Write and compare simple sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble, selection)
- Understand and apply recursion with base cases
- Practice tracing code execution and call stacks

---

### Module 5: Object-Oriented Python

Master the principles of object-oriented programming to model complex systems. You’ll create classes, work with inheritance, and handle errors gracefully.

**Topics covered:**

- Define classes, attributes, and instance methods
- Implement inheritance and method overriding
- Use special methods (e.g., __init__, __str__)
- Handle exceptions with try, except, and finally
- Perform file I/O: read from and write to text files

---

### Module 6: Practical Tools & Mini-Projects

Integrate essential development tools and build small end-to-end projects. You’ll learn version control, package management, and create both CLI and simple web applications.

**Topics covered:**

- Initialize Git repos, commit changes, and push to GitHub
- Set up virtual environments and install packages with pip
- Build a command-line tool using argparse
- Create a basic web app with Flask (routes, templates)
- Debug and test code using assertions and unittest

---

### Module 7: Capstone Project: Real Application Development

Apply everything you’ve learned to plan, build, and deploy a complete application. This project will demonstrate your skills and prepare you for real-world coding challenges.

**Topics covered:**

- Choose a project idea and draft functional requirements
- Design project structure, modules, and data models
- Implement features iteratively, writing tests as you go
- Deploy the application to a hosting service (Heroku, Netlify)
- Document the project and present code on GitHub
