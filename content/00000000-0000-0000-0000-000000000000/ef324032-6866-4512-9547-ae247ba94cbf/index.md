## Learning Path

### ðŸ“š Module 1: Foundations of Data Engineering

Get acquainted with the core responsibilities of a data engineer, establish a solid development environment, and learn version control and basic scripting. Lay the groundwork for all subsequent modules.

**Topics covered:**

- Understand the role and lifecycle of data engineering
- Set up a Linux environment and master essential shell commands
- Version control with Git: clone, commit, branch, merge
- Introduction to Python: data types, control flow, and scripts

---

### ðŸ“š Module 2: Relational Databases & SQL

Dive into relational database design and SQL querying. Learn how to model data, write efficient queries, and optimize performance for production workloads.

**Topics covered:**

- Database schema design: normalization, primary/foreign keys
- SQL DDL & DML: CREATE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE
- Advanced queries: INNER/OUTER JOINs and subqueries
- Window functions and common table expressions (CTEs)
- Indexing strategies and basic query optimization

---

### ðŸ“š Module 3: Python for Data Manipulation

Master Python tools and libraries for data processing and cleansing. Automate routine tasks and prepare data for downstream analytics or pipeline ingestion.

**Topics covered:**

- Isolate projects with virtual environments and pip
- DataFrames in Pandas: loading, cleaning, transforming data
- Working with file formats: CSV, JSON, Parquet
- Consuming APIs and handling HTTP requests
- Automation scripts: scheduling and error handling

---

### ðŸ“š Module 4: Designing ETL Pipelines

Learn the principles and architecture of ETL/ELT processes. Use workflow orchestration tools to build, schedule, and monitor robust data pipelines.

**Topics covered:**

- ETL vs. ELT concepts and best practices
- Building DAGs with Apache Airflow: operators, sensors, hooks
- Modular pipeline design and parameterization
- Logging, alerting, and error recovery strategies
- Testing data pipelines: unit tests and integration tests

---

### ðŸ“š Module 5: Cloud Data Engineering

Explore major cloud platforms and managed data services. Learn to provision, secure, and deploy scalable data infrastructure using IaC.

**Topics covered:**

- Core cloud concepts: IaaS, PaaS, serverless
- Object storage and managed databases (e.g., S3, RDS, BigQuery)
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform or CloudFormation
- Serverless ETL with AWS Lambda or GCP Cloud Functions
- Cost estimation and resource monitoring

---

### ðŸ“š Module 6: Big Data Ecosystem

Handle large-scale data processing with distributed systems. Gain hands-on experience with batch and streaming frameworks.

**Topics covered:**

- Hadoop and HDFS architecture fundamentals
- Apache Spark: RDDs, DataFrames, Spark SQL
- Real-time streaming with Apache Kafka
- Data lake vs. data warehouse paradigms
- Optimizing performance in distributed environments

---

### ðŸ“š Module 7: Modern Practices & Production Readiness

Adopt industry best practices to ensure pipeline reliability, security, and maintainability. Learn how to operate data workloads at scale.

**Topics covered:**

- CI/CD for data pipelines: automated testing and deployment
- Data observability: monitoring, logging, and alerting
- Data quality frameworks: validation, profiling, lineage
- Security and compliance: IAM, encryption, GDPR
- Cost optimization and governance strategies
